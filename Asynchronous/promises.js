// A JavaScript Promise object can be:
// Pending
// Fulfilled
// Rejected
// The Promise object supports two properties: state and result.
// While a Promise object is "pending" (working), the result is undefined.
// When a Promise object is "fulfilled", the result is a value.
// When a Promise object is "rejected", the result is an error object
//promise had to be settled when it eithr fullfill or rejected
